I live in Bangalore, and like most of the people there I am also a Software Engineer. I love talking and playing around with technology, espically linux and python, and like to automate most of the things. 

Also a member of PuduvaiGLUG, a Free Software lover, likes teaching, and love sanskrit for its vast beauty as a language.

## Life works I currently do:

    * Promote Free Software where eva possible.
    * Teach Sanskrit. (Online too... Intrested , Drop me a line @ ram.seshan.cs@gmail.com)
    * This Website
