As a part of our work at Fractalio, we wanted to build a custom Cent- OS ISO, to be able to circulate it amongst people for them test and get a feel of what we are trying to build.  We had a trail once before and we had failed miserably building nothing.

Well we wanted to give it a shot again. This time with the previous learnings as our pillar. This time we started reading a lot more articles and links to first understand what is being talked about and have a clear picture of what is to be done.

This article will share all the learning that I went through to actually get something working. So lets get started.

Best Practices

> Span a virtual machine with centos - 6.6 minimal installed. So that if something goes wrong it dosent mess up your system

**Pre-Requisites :**

1. A virtual machine
2. Centos 6.6 Minimal ISO
3. Internet or the packages (.rpm files) along with all the dependencies
4. A mind to be ready to expriment and learn :-)


So Span out the virtual machine you installed with Centos and execute the following instructions. Each command will also be accompanied with the details of why it is done. If you find something wrong, please do let me know in the comments. So poweron your virtual machine and follow on


**1 . Initial Setup:**

    :::bash
    yum -y install rsync yum-utils createrepo genisoimage  isomd5sum yum-downloadonly
      """  
     - rsync to sync to actual iso to your re-spin
     - createrepo to make a folder with special permission so that the installed recognises the rpm inside this folder
     - genisoimage to generate the iso from the custom packages
     - yum-downloadonly  is a yum plugin to only download the rpms and not actually install it
     """
**2 . Get the files required**

    :::bash
    cd /root
    mkdir respin-centos

    mount -o loop,ro /root/CentOS-6.6-x86_64-minimal.iso /mnt
    rsync -av /mnt/ .

    find . -name TRANS.TBL -exec rm -f {} \;
      """
    - respin-centos is the folder where we will build our iso from
    - mount is to actually mount the iso in some mount point so that you can access the files. This is in an assumption that you have copied the actual iso to the /root partitiion of the VM or the iso building machine.
    - rsync is needed because the cp sometimes dosent copy all the hidden files. files like .discinfo .treeinfo are missed when you do a cp -r . So we use rsync, which dosent differenciate between these files
    - The last line removed the unwanted files. that file is unwanted.
    """

**3 . Get the packages you want to install.**

We will be installing python-devel, python-pip and httpd.

    :::bash
    yum install -y python-devel python-pip httpd --downloadonly --downloaddir /root/respin-centos/Packages/
    """
    - Remember the yum-downloadonly ? we are actually doing it here. This will download the the rpms and the dependency rpms to the Packages folder.
    """

**4 . Test the rpms**

Now we check the package we add in ISO above is require any dependencies.If require than we add  dependencies.

    :::bash
    rpm –initdb –dbpath /root/build/Packages/

    rpm -ivh –test –dbpath /root/build/Packages/ /root/build/Packages/*.rpm
    After using above command if output is as shown below than we need to resolve fail dependencies.

    warning: /root/build/Packages/acl-2.2.49-6.el6.x86_64.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA1 Signature, key ID c105b9de: NOKEY
    error: Failed dependencies:
    /etc/mime.types is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
    apr-util-ldap is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
    httpd-tools = 2.2.15-26.el6.centos is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
    libapr-1.so.0()(64bit) is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
    libaprutil-1.so.0()(64bit) is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64

Do not worry about warning messages.Our focus is only on fail dependencies as shown above.We require to download failed dependencies.Using below command to check yum provides these dependencies.

    :::bash
    yum provides “*/etc/mime.types*”

Once you download all  dependencies  once again run below command to check all dependencies downloaded.

    :::bash
    rpm -ivh –test –dbpath /root/build/Packages/ /root/build/Packages/*.rpm

The log show  following texts if all dependencies downloaded.

    :::bash
    warning: /root/build/Packages/acl-2.2.49-6.el6.x86_64.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA1 Signature, key ID c105b9de: NOKEY

**5 . Repodata**

We need a file called the comps.xml to actually get the iso to work. Follow the steps below to actually get the file

    :::bash
    ls repodata/

    repomd.xml

    mv repodata/ce2d698b9fb1413b668443e88835a0642cea8f387c7f25cc946f56dd93f109bb-c6-minimal-x86_64.xml repodata/comps.xml

**6 . Create the repo**

    :::bash
    createrepo -u "media://`head -1 .discinfo`" -g repodata/comps.xml .

**7 . The Kickstart file**

The ks file is very important. Refer to a sample kickstart file here (https://github.com/ramaseshan/respin-iso/centos-6.6-x86-64)

If you look at the reference kickstart, there would be two post sections. One with chroot and the other without chroot (nochroot).
The difference between the two is

- If you want to do some non root operations like copying files that just have to be present in the new iso they can be done through the nochroot stuff.  Things like, copy, untar, modifying conf files, sed, awk etc. Hold There is more readon.
How are we actually copying files is simple, there are 3 componenets involved here, the vmlinuz (the actual installer, /mnt/source, wehere the iso is mounted, and the /mnt/sysimage, where the installing system is mounted. Read the sameple ks file to see a live example)
Refer to the next section on where the to be copied files will be.


- But if you want root operations like useradd, chmod etc, do it in the post section with chroot on. **


**8 . How to copy files**

    :::bash
    [root@localhost respin-centos]# mkdir tar
    [root@localhost respin-centos]# touch tar/test
    [root@localhost respin-centos]# ls tar/
    test

Now you can copy this tar folder like this in the nochroot section of the ks file

    :::bash
    cp -r /mnt/source/tar /mnt/sysimage/opt/

**9 . isolinux**

    :::bash
    chmod 755 isolinux/isolinux.cfg
    #modify the isolinux.cfg to make it work like this

    default linux
    prompt 0
    timeout 600
    display boot.msg
    F1 boot.msg
    F2 options.msg
    F3 general.msg
    F4 param.msg
    F5 rescue.msg
    label linux
    kernel vmlinuz
    append initrd=initrd.img ks=cdrom:/ks.cfg ( Add this entry in this line )

**10 . Generate the iso**

    :::bash
    mkisofs -r -R -J -T -v -no-emul-boot \
      -boot-load-size 4 \
      -boot-info-table \
      -V "respin-centos" \
      -p "Ramaseshan" \
      -A "respin-centos-build1" \
      -b isolinux/isolinux.bin \
      -c isolinux/boot.cat \
      -x "lost+found" \
      --joliet-long \
      -o /tmp/boot.iso .

Yay !! We have the iso now. No go span another VM and start testing it :-)

I have  my ks file and the quick commands docs and also the reference links I had used. Incase if you feel, I have written too much and need the commands quick. :-)
