I was quite exicted about this for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mentors were all participants of Django Girls in Bangalore this year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their mentor was a fellow Free Software Activist at FSFTN (@srravya)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FSMK was celebrating women's months with all women speakers and mentors all over the month. First time I was hearing that. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was absolutely jobless on that day, and attending this event meant spending some useful time with a great set of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this article is not about the event, as such, but about a common mistake that people do with python. A common mistake that was also done in this hands-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is "Checking in the virtualenv folder along with the source code of the project". This article is intended to explain , why that is a bad practice, and why you should never do such a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before going into the details of why that was wrong and stuff, Lets understand what is a virtualenv, and why it is a good practise to use virtualenv to all your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, virtualenv by defination is about, creating seperate environments for project specific dependencies. In layman terms, lets say, we are working in "project 1" with dependencies Django-1.8 and django-allauth , and "project 2" with dependencies Django-1.9 and django-allauth. You can already see what could go wrong. If not, you see the two projects require the same package(Django) of different versions(1.8 and 1.9). Now your system cant have both the version installed together, so you need a solution here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common solution is to upgrade your Django-1.8 to Django-1.9 and be happy. But that dosent work always. Once you start a project, you aim should be on writing code, rather than keep upgrading the package. The other way to put a solution is to say, "No matter what, I will work only with Django 1.9". But the question is how long ? And when you decide to upgrade, how many projects will you upgrade or and how sure are we with all the dependencies of the projects ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So none of these are viable solutions. They could work for some small time fun projects, but wont run in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets say, I am exploring a lot of free projects based on python, and one project looks interesting. If I just want to explore to see if it works or not, why would I want to install the whole package in my base system? What if those packages, conflict with my base system or downgrade some of my system packages ? So what would you do ? No with python your dont need virtual machines. That is an overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now talking about the base system, we all do a common mistake forgetting the common statement in free world "With Great power comes greater responsibilities". Yes, if you understand what the great power is, I am talking about "sudo".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo pip install package_name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, again, unless you completely understand what the package does, and what system files does this change. Never do this, It could end up breaking a lot of the system dependencies. What ?? How ? Now that is another topic, will soon write up on "When to think sudo".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what would you do ? Well, you already know the answer, but still spilling the beans, the solution is &lt;strong&gt;virtualenv&lt;/strong&gt;. How is that a solution ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtualenv takes a different stand in solving the dependency issues of a project. So just like virtual machines, you create virtual python environments, that uses the &lt;strong&gt;system's python&lt;/strong&gt; and keep all your dependencies in a virtual machine like space, that will never conflict your system packges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Psst ! Please note and remember "System's Python". Very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently , with virtualenv , You don’t want to have to set up a whole new server with a different version of Django to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that has given a breif overview of what is a virtualenv and how it is useful, lets come to the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all use version control, for commiting and keeping our code publically visible for all various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is a task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few python projects, have a look at their root tree source code . Dont take more than 2 min's for each project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django [https://github.com/django/django]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numpy [https://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scipy [https://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pelican [https://github.com/getpelican/pelican]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now to the question, in any of these projects that you saw, did you see the virtualenv files checked in ??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very obviously "no" right ?? Great, point proved. !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nopes, I am stopping there. I am kinda long always :-D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets also understand why, do they not checkin, and what are the effects of checking it in ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source/Version control system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;(GIT,SVN etc) are for the code you write, not for the system packages/binaries that is tied to your system.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python could be wrongly referred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;What ? Do you remember &amp;quot;system&amp;#39;s python&amp;quot; I mentioned before. How do you create a virtualenv ?

Do you do a sudo apt/dnf install python-virtualenv

and

virtualenv blog

Now when you do that command, it actually makes a reference to your system&amp;#39;s python binary for its execution. It does not install a new version of python.

I know, you still dont trust me, well dont. Try it for yourself. Now open your command line, and explore . .

Hmmm, How ?

Here you go.

 - Without any virtualenv, type &amp;quot;which python&amp;quot;
        You should see &amp;quot;/usr/bin/python&amp;quot;
 - Now Activate a virtualenv, and type &amp;quot;which python&amp;quot;

   Now assuming, I have create a virtualenv called test in my   /tmp directory, my output would be something like &amp;quot;/tmp/test/bin/python&amp;quot;.

    Now if you do a ls -latr /tmp/test/bin/python , you will see that it is referring itself to the system python ? Do you ?? Now that is a good reason, why you should never checkin your virtualenv.

I am still not convinced. Well read on, the next 3 points.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People use different versions of python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Now, I am a young guy, but always loves to use the most stable stuff. So I dont use the latest python, I rather use a stable release. So now lets say, you create a virtualenv with a differnt version of python (python3 for example) and I still run a python2, your virtual machine&amp;#39;s binary would still be pointing to python3 of your system, but whereas when I pull the code on a system that dosent have python3, I would have to delete all your system generated binary files of python3 and recreate all the binaries for python2 again. Which is a lot of pain. (well actually not, with virtualenv all I have to do is to copy your source code and put it in a virtualenv I create with my python)

So, not checking the virtualenv also solved the different versions of python issue.

Looking it from a free software prespective, I am talking about Freedom to choose the version of python I want to run. But with checking in the virtualenv binaries, you would be forcing me either to do a lot more work, or to use the same version of python as your run.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People use different architecture of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Heard of 32 bit&amp;#39;s (Yes, they still exist a lot) , 64 bits, ARM etc. Well, when I compile python for differnt architectures, my binaries itself could change. In simple words, if you, say pip install mysql-python, on a 64 bit machine, and then someone with a 32 bit machine tries to use it, it will not work.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People still use the most crappy and spying Windows, and yet they could use your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Now, lets say, you have checked in the code with your virtualenv, and I pull it on a windows machine. (Remember that is just for an example, and Microsoft, if you are reading this, I dont pirate you anymore, rather I dont use you atall.) If your reaction to that was &amp;quot;Duh&amp;quot;, I tried to make a joke, and it ended up being a PJ. So move on.

Now I pull down your code on a Windows machine, remember the virtualenv python references to something called &amp;quot;/usr/bin/python&amp;quot; ?? It dosent even exist in Windows. Its called python2.7.exe in windows (assuming you have setup all the environment variables correctly). Now that could fail.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So always, remember always check in the source, not the result of running a process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtualenv is rather platform specific; a Windows virtualenv may require different binaries than one created on Linux. The paths in the script files will almost certainly use absolute paths, not relative paths tying a virtualenv to a specific location on your harddisk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the best practise is only to check the source and give a requirements.txt that will install all the required binaries for the project. (If this line didnt make sense, read up about, python-pip, pip freeze and pip install -r requirements.txt )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming, you are satisfied with not checking in the virtualenv as a part of "source control system", the bigger question is, How did people even think of checking in the virtualenv ??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, aparently looking the docs of the tutorial of "Django Girls", where they have mentioned to checkin the virtualenv as a part of the code. &lt;a href="http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/deploy/index.html#starting-our-git-repository"&gt;Refer here for the instructions on Django Girls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to those who attended, Django Girls, if any of you could file a issue/bug in their docs, and ask them to correct it, it could help of a lot of people who are using it for reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belive me, Django Girls tutorial, is one of the very best Django kickstarters available out there. Its totally awesome. To anybody who say, "I want to learn Django", that is the first url I always share. A great community effort, and being a community, we have to notify the people, when something is wrong.  So if some of you who attended Django Girls or mentored Django girls, would be kind enough to file a bug, and let them know, I would be a happy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos and thanks again, if you read every line of the article or just skipped all the lines in between and came to this line just for a kudos :-D&lt;/p&gt;

After about taking a few 10 interview candidates at my workplace, I am actually suprised. I was able to get it right the fist attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the question ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a simple question, but a lot of them get it wrong the first time. So what do people write as solutions ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Fizz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Buzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;FizzBuzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well this is the code, that all the people I have talked to have written in their first attempt. I used to actually be surprised initially but then I started expecting this answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is wrong here ? What are we to learn from a code like this ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we fail to realize that we are writing a set of instructions,  a computer is going to execute. Well a computer is a brain less machine. Yes it does not have a brain like you and me.
So any instruction given to a computer has to be step by step. It has to be logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we dont think like a computer. We think like human beings. The above logic when thought like a human, will work perfectly. Why ? we apparently apply a certain amount of logic on top of a logic. Yep ! Knowingly or unknowingly we do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say the code is wrong to an interview candidate, I usually see this reaction in their face "Hey ! Hold on !! What is wrong with that code ?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple. That is when I say "Execute your logic for the first 20 numbers." Yep, you could try too. If you still get the output right for the first 20 number on the above code, again read up the second point I have talked about. "Think like a computer, not like a human being" .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still get it right, dont worry , here is why it is wrong.
1. Lets take 3. The above code will print "Fizz" . Why ? The first if condition satisfies.
2. Lets take 5. The above code will print "Buzz". Why ? The second condition satisfies.
3. Lets take 15. Why 15 ? It is the first number divisible from both 3 and 5. The above code will print "FizzBuzz". Why ? The third condition satisfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right ! Hey hold on ...! Something is fishy here.  The third condition .. Isint that wrong ?? Wouldnt that print "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz" ?
If this thought has come to you, yes you are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets analyze a little more. What does an "if" statement do ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a condition is satisfied, it executes a set of instructions. Right ? Now for a moment lets think like machines and look at the above code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the number 15, lets run though the first condition. 15 is divisible by 3. Yes the condition is true. So it would print "Fizz". Thats it. That is how a machine works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the difference between "Natural Human Language" and "Computer Language".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computer can just execute instruction given by you and me. It does not have a brain by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further delay, lets get to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;FizzBuzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Fizz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Buzz&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You see the re-arrangement in the logic ? Now run though the three numbers 3,5,15 and the code should work good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Psst ! Can you optimize the code a little more ?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is very simple. When a problem has an ambiguity in terms of condition, always double think the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, when you write code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always think like a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a trail once before and we had failed miserably building nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We build statues out of snow, and weep to see them melt. -- Walter Scott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well we wanted to give it a shot again. This time with the previous learnings as our pillar. This time we started reading a lot more articles and links to first understand what is being talked about and have a clear picture of what is to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't build a great building on a weak foundation. You must have a solid foundation if you're going to have a strong superstructure. -- Gordon B. Hinckley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will share all the learning that I went through to actually get something working. So lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Span a virtual machine with centos - 6.6 minimal installed. So that if something goes wrong it dosent mess up your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Requisites :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A virtual machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centos 6.6 Minimal ISO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet or the packages (.rpm files) along with all the dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mind to be ready to expriment and learn :-)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Span out the virtual machine you installed with Centos and execute the following instructions. Each command will also be accompanied with the details of why it is done. If you find something wrong, please do let me know in the comments. So poweron your virtual machine and follow on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 . Initial Setup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;yum -y install rsync yum-utils createrepo genisoimage  isomd5sum yum-downloadonly
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt; - rsync to sync to actual iso to your re-spin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt; - createrepo to make a folder with special permission so that the installed recognises the rpm inside this folder&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt; - genisoimage to generate the iso from the custom packages&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt; - yum-downloadonly  is a yum plugin to only download the rpms and not actually install it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 . Get the files required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /root
mkdir respin-centos

mount -o loop,ro /root/CentOS-6.6-x86_64-minimal.iso /mnt
rsync -av /mnt/ .

find . -name TRANS.TBL -exec rm -f &lt;span class="o"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;- respin-centos is the folder where we will build our iso from&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;- mount is to actually mount the iso in some mount point so that you can access the files. This is in an assumption that you have copied the actual iso to the /root partitiion of the VM or the iso building machine.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;- rsync is needed because the cp sometimes dosent copy all the hidden files. files like .discinfo .treeinfo are missed when you do a cp -r . So we use rsync, which dosent differenciate between these files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;- The last line removed the unwanted files. that file is unwanted.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 . Get the packages you want to install.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be installing python-devel, python-pip and httpd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;yum install -y python-devel python-pip httpd --downloadonly --downloaddir /root/respin-centos/Packages/
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;- Remember the yum-downloadonly ? we are actually doing it here. This will download the the rpms and the dependency rpms to the Packages folder.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 . Test the rpms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we check the package we add in ISO above is require any dependencies.If require than we add  dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;rpm –initdb –dbpath /root/build/Packages/

rpm -ivh –test –dbpath /root/build/Packages/ /root/build/Packages/*.rpm
After using above &lt;span class="nb"&gt;command &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; output is as shown below than we need to resolve fail dependencies.

warning: /root/build/Packages/acl-2.2.49-6.el6.x86_64.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA1 Signature, key ID c105b9de: NOKEY
error: Failed dependencies:
/etc/mime.types is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
apr-util-ldap is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
httpd-tools &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; 2.2.15-26.el6.centos is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
libapr-1.so.0&lt;span class="o"&gt;()(&lt;/span&gt;64bit&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
libaprutil-1.so.0&lt;span class="o"&gt;()(&lt;/span&gt;64bit&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; is needed by httpd-2.2.15-26.el6.centos.x86_64
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do not worry about warning messages.Our focus is only on fail dependencies as shown above.We require to download failed dependencies.Using below command to check yum provides these dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;yum provides “*/etc/mime.types*”
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you download all  dependencies  once again run below command to check all dependencies downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;rpm -ivh –test –dbpath /root/build/Packages/ /root/build/Packages/*.rpm
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The log show  following texts if all dependencies downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;warning: /root/build/Packages/acl-2.2.49-6.el6.x86_64.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA1 Signature, key ID c105b9de: NOKEY

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 . Repodata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a file called the comps.xml to actually get the iso to work. Follow the steps below to actually get the file&lt;/p&gt;

repomd.xml

mv repodata/ce2d698b9fb1413b668443e88835a0642cea8f387c7f25cc946f56dd93f109bb-c6-minimal-x86_64.xml repodata/comps.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 . Create the repo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;createrepo -u &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;media://`head -1 .discinfo`&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; -g repodata/comps.xml .
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 . The Kickstart file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ks file is very important. Refer to a sample kickstart file here (https://github.com/ramaseshan/respin-iso/centos-6.6-x86-64)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the reference kickstart, there would be two post sections. One with chroot and the other without chroot (nochroot).
The difference between the two is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do some non root operations like copying files that just have to be present in the new iso they can be done through the nochroot stuff.  Things like, copy, untar, modifying conf files, sed, awk etc. Hold There is more readon.
How are we actually copying files is simple, there are 3 componenets involved here, the vmlinuz (the actual installer, /mnt/source, wehere the iso is mounted, and the /mnt/sysimage, where the installing system is mounted. Read the sameple ks file to see a live example)
Refer to the next section on where the to be copied files will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you want root operations like useradd, chmod etc, do it in the post section with chroot on. **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 . How to copy files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;root@localhost respin-centos&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# mkdir tar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;root@localhost respin-centos&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# touch tar/test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;root@localhost respin-centos&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# ls tar/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now you can copy this tar folder like this in the nochroot section of the ks file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cp -r /mnt/source/tar /mnt/sysimage/opt/
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 . isolinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;chmod &lt;span class="m"&gt;755&lt;/span&gt; isolinux/isolinux.cfg
&lt;span class="c"&gt;#modify the isolinux.cfg to make it work like this&lt;/span&gt;

default linux
prompt 0
timeout 600
display boot.msg
F1 boot.msg
F2 options.msg
F3 general.msg
F4 param.msg
F5 rescue.msg
label linux
kernel vmlinuz
append &lt;span class="nv"&gt;initrd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;initrd.img &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;cdrom:/ks.cfg &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; Add this entry in this line &lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 . Generate the iso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mkisofs -r -R -J -T -v -no-emul-boot &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -boot-load-size &lt;span class="m"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -boot-info-table &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -V &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;respin-centos&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -p &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Ramaseshan&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -A &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;respin-centos-build1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -b isolinux/isolinux.bin &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -c isolinux/boot.cat &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  -x &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;lost+found&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay !! We have the iso now. No go span another VM and start testing it :-)&lt;/p&gt;

Salt also does a lot of remote execution and configuration management too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official docs can be found here : http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to talk about how to use SaltStack with python. We at Fractalio Data, heavily rely on SaltStack for various operations. We basically build Data Storage Servers, and we want to regulary keep package updates running on all the servers, manage configurations, get status and resource utiliation of each individual nodes, restart services incase of failures, transfer log and other files between nodes and more. Apart from the development team, our testing team is completely automated using SaltStack. We have automated the test suite for one server, and same test suite is executed on all the servers parallely and the final results and gathered from all the servers and mined for all useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss a basic usage of SaltStack with python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-requisites :
    1. You should have installed Salt master and have atleast one salt minion.
    2. You should have received the minion request on the master (not necessarily accepted)
    3. You should be the root user or the user who has access to salt. It will be defined in the master config (/etc/salt/master grep for user)
    4. This code has to be run on the same machine as Salt master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the terminal and go to the python console typing python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the Salt wheel client to accept the minions. Wheels are used for interating with various parts of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will get all the pending minions to be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;salt.wheel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;opts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;master_config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;/etc/salt/master&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;#The path of your salt master configuration&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;wheel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wheel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Wheel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;opts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Initialize the wheel with various salt opts&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wheel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;key.list_all&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pending_minions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;minions_pre&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pending_minions&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and this code would accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pending_minions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wheel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;key.accept&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)):&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Error accepting Minion key for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Error accepting Minion key for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt; : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Viola ! And you are done accepting the minions. Lets first test if the minions are accepted properly and explore more on what the above code is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;salt.client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LocalClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;test.ping&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Seshan@fractalio&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Yay, the minion has responded.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So lets now explore more of what the above code is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first code block, we had these lines :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wheel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;key.list_all&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pending_minions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;minions_pre&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keys variable will contain all the keys that the salt master contains. Irrespective of if they are accepted or not accpeted or rejected, the keys variable will contain all the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pending_minions will contain all the not accepted minions. Why is called minions_pre, why not minions_pending ?? Do an &lt;strong&gt; ls /etc/salt/pki/master/ &lt;/strong&gt; , and you will figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second code block :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wheel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;key.accept&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;match&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above code says the wheel client to passes 'accept' request and the minion key as an argument to the call_func. The whole if condition and the and try blocks are basic python to safely handle the failed cases and etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have got the basic hello world working. Now lets explore more on this, shall we.

If you are looking for the basics, please refer here. ramaseshan.github.io/technology/2015/04/02/saltstack-and-python/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic ls command example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;salt.client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LocalClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;cmd.run&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ls&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and the output would be :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;{&amp;#39;Seshan@fractalio&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Desktop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Documents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Downloads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Music&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Pictures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Templates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Videos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;test&amp;#39;}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does the above code do ?
The above code in the terminal is executed as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ls&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lets look at the various components of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LocalClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;\*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tells&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;minions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;You&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;things&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;192.168.1.20\*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;which&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;will&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;minions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;called&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gobbling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SaltStack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;also&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;supports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;regular&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expressions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;salt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;used&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;terminal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;specified&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;client.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;Eg&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="nn"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;highstate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ls&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;passed&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Other&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;examples&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;service network restart&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you want to pass a parameter to ls ?? then you can say ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;*&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;cmd.run&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ls&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;/tmp&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most of the things you can accomplish by the above, but have a list of all the available modules in saltstack here : http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you would have also heard about grains in SaltStack.
If you want to target minions by the grains, then here is what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cmd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;roles:primary&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;cmd.run&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ls&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;expr_form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;grain&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So instead of using '*', we use the grain key and value, and say explicitly that the expr_form='grain'.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="[technology"></category><category term="saltstack"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="saltapi"></category><category term="salt-operations]"></category></entry></feed>
